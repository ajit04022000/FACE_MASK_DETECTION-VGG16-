### ABSTRACT
* Global pandemic COVID-19 circumstances emerged in an epidemic of dangerous
disease in all over the world. Wearing a face mask will help prevent the spread of
infection and prevent the individual from contracting any airborne infectious germs.
Using Face Mask Detection System, one can monitor if the people are wearing masks
or not.
* Here HAAR-CASACADE algorithm is used for image detection. Collating with other
existing algorithms, this classifier produces a high recognition rate even with varying
expressions, efficient feature selection and low assortment of false positive features.
HAAR feature-based cascade classifier system utilizes only 200 features out of 6000
features to yield a recognition rate of 85-95%.
* According to this motivation we demand mask detection as a unique and public health
service system during the global pandemic COVID-19 epidemic. The model is trained
by face mask image and non-face mask image.
